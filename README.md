ATAC-seq data quality was assessed with fastqc (Andrews, 2010). Adapter sequences were trimmed using fastp (Chen et al., 2018). Reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome assembly using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) in sensitive-local mode. Alignments were filtered to remove reads with multiple valid alignments (mapq > 1). Coverage signal tracks were generated using deepTools bamCoverage (Ram√≠rez et al., 2014) and normalized on a per-million basis using R(R Core Team, 2020). Peaks were called using macs2 (Zhang et al., 2008) with default settings, pooling all datasets as input, using a minimum -log10 q-value threshold of 100. Reads mapping within peaks were counted using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014), and differential accessibility was determined using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014), considering peaks with adjusted p-values lower than 0.1 as significantly differentially accessible (DA). All DESeq2 comparisons were performed using the full matrix of high, medium, and low concentration collagen ATAC-seq scores, so pairwise comparisons were assessed for significance in the context of global variation across all three conditions. HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) (Heinz et al., 2010) was used for annotation of DA peaks. Metaprofiles were generated using the BRGenomics R package (DeBerardine, 2020), and are representative of average and 75% confidence interval over indicated sets of peaks calculated by subsampling 10% of peaks 1,000 times. Peaks that overlap with the region from -1,000 to transcription start site (TSS) of any annotated transcript in the hg38 genome assembly were considered promoter-associated, and all other peaks were considered non-promoter-associated. All promoter-associated peaks with the nearest non-promoter-associated peaks closer than 500 kb were considered enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI). Enrichment of transposable element (TE) overlaps with the DA peaks was performed using the script TE-anaysis_Shuffle_bed.pl (https://github.com/4ureliek/TEanalysis) (Kapusta et al., 2013; Lynch et al., 2015).
